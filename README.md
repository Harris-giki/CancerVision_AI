## üîç Overview

CancerVision AI implements a **Vision Transformer-based transfer learning approach** for mammogram classification, achieving exceptional accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malignant breast masses. The system is designed to assist medical professionals in early cancer detection and diagnosis. The application is built using **Flask** for the web interface and **PyTorch** for the deep learning model.
